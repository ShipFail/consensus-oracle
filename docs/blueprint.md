## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to convey trustworthiness and intelligence.
- Background color: Light Gray (#ECEFF1), a desaturated version of indigo, to ensure content stands out without causing eye strain.
- Accent color: Soft Orange (#FFAB40) for highlighting key elements such as the golden truth answer and call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for its modern and objective look; will be used for both headings and body text.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent confidence levels (e.g., checkmarks, stars, or agreement bars).
- Emphasize the 'golden truth' answer box, and make 'copy link' easily accessible.
- Subtle animations on result loads
